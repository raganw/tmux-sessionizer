/// rotating file in the XDG data directory.

/// # Arguments
///
/// * `config` - The application configuration, used to determine the log level.
///
/// # Returns
///
/// * `Result<LoggerGuard>` - Returns a guard that must be kept alive for logging.
///                           Returns an error if setup fails (e.g., directory creation).

// The Logger struct mentioned in the spec might not be necessary if we only have an init function.
// Let's proceed with the init function approach as implied by later steps.
