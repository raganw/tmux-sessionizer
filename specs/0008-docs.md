## High-Level Objective

- Complete the documentation and add final polish to the application

## Mid-Level Objective

- Add comprehensive documentation to all modules
- Create user-friendly help and usage messages
- Add examples and documentation tests
- Ensure code follows Rust best practices
- Add CI configuration

## Implementation Notes

- Follow the documentation conventions from CONVENTIONS.md
- Use doc comments (`///`) for all public items
- Include examples in documentation
- Use appropriate Markdown formatting
- Consider adding a man page

## Context

### Beginning context

- All files from previous specifications

### Ending context

- All files updated with documentation
- `.github/` directory with CI configuration
- `examples/` directory with example usage

## Low-Level Tasks

> Ordered from start to finish

1. Add documentation to all modules

```aider
UPDATE all source files to add comprehensive documentation.
Add doc comments (`///`) to:
- Module-level documentation
- Struct and enum documentation
- Function and method documentation
Include examples where appropriate.
```

2. Improve help and usage messages

```aider
UPDATE src/config.rs to improve CLI help messages.
Enhance clap configuration to:
- Provide detailed help for each option
- Add examples in the help text
- Show version information
- Group related options
```

3. Add documentation tests

```aider
UPDATE source files to include documentation tests.
Add examples that serve as both documentation and tests.
Ensure examples are runnable and correct.
```

4. Create examples

```aider
CREATE examples/ directory with example usage.
Add example scripts showing:
- Basic usage
- Advanced configuration
- Integration with other tools
```

5. Add CI configuration

```aider
CREATE .github/workflows/ci.yml for continuous integration.
Configure GitHub Actions to:
- Build the project
- Run tests
- Run lints (clippy)
- Check formatting (rustfmt)
- Run on multiple platforms
```

6. Final code review and cleanup

```aider
REVIEW all code to ensure it follows best practices.
Check for:
- Proper error handling
- Consistent naming conventions
- Code organization
- Unnecessary dependencies
- Performance issues
Make necessary adjustments.
```
