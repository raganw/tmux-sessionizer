# Specification 5: Tmux Session Management

> Ingest the information from this file, implement the Low-Level Tasks, and generate the code that will satisfy the High and Mid-Level Objectives.

## High-Level Objective

- Implement tmux session management functionality

## Mid-Level Objective

- Generate valid tmux session names from directory paths
- Check if tmux is running and if specific sessions exist
- Create new tmux sessions or switch to existing ones
- Implement the same session behavior as the bash script

## Implementation Notes

- Use proper error handling for tmux commands
- Sanitize session names similarly to the bash script
- Handle the different cases: no tmux running, tmux running but session doesn't exist, session exists
- Prefer using the tmux_interface crate for tmux operations
- Follow the same session naming convention as the bash script

## Low-Level Tasks

> Ordered from start to finish

1. Create session manager module

```aider
UPDATE src/session_manager.rs:
  Define a SessionManager struct that will handle tmux operations.
  Implement methods to:
  - Generate sanitized session names from paths
  - Special handling for worktree naming format: [parent] worktree
  - Check if a tmux server is running
  - Check if a specific session exists
```

2. Implement session creation and switching

```aider
UPDATE src/session_manager.rs:
  Implement session management.
  Add methods to:
  - Create a new tmux session with a given name and directory
  - Switch to an existing session
  - Handle the case where tmux is not running
  - Handle appropriate error conditions
```

3. Implement Selection struct and logic

```aider
UPDATE src/session_manager.rs:
  Define a Selection struct.
  The Selection should include:
  - path: PathBuf
  - display_name: String
  - session_name: String
  Add methods to create a Selection from a DirectoryEntry.
```

4. Integrate session manager with main

```aider
UPDATE src/main.rs:
  Use the SessionManager.
  Update the main function to:
  - Create a Selection from the chosen DirectoryEntry
  - Initialize the SessionManager
  - Create or switch to the appropriate tmux session
  - Handle errors properly
```
